# Questions

- Real-world objects contain _state_ and _behavior__.
- A software object's state is stored in _fields__.
- A software object's behavior is exposed through _method__.
- Hiding internal data from the outside world, and accessing it only through publicly exposed methods is known as data _encapsulation__.
- A blueprint for a software object is called a _class__.
- Common behavior can be defined in a _parent class__ and inherited into a _child class__ using the _extends__ keyword.
- A collection of methods with no implementation is called an _interfaces__.
- A namespace that organizes classes and interfaces by functionality is called a _packages__.
- The term API stands for _Application programming interface__?

# Exercises
- Assume that you are sitting in a evergreen forest, create a class for all the entities which you observe.
- For each new class that you've created above, create an interface that defines its behavior, then require your class to implement it. Omit one or two methods and try compiling. What does the error look like?
